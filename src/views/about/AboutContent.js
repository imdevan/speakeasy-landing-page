# FAQ

**How much do you charge?**

It depends, letâ€™s chat and we can work out a cost that works for both of us. <br/><br/>

**What if I canâ€™t afford your services?** 

Get in touch with us anyway and weâ€™ll work something out.
<br/><br/>

**Do you build web apps?**

Yes! Thatâ€™s our speciality. We work with React on the front end and are familiar with all things javascript.
<br/><br/>

**What's a web app?**

Web apps are apps that run on the web. Like Google docs, amazon, or your email, instead of this website you're currently viewing or a blog. 
<br/><br/>

**Isn't that just a website**

Kind of, there is definitely overlap. Web apps are basically websites with a lot of moving parts.
<br/><br/>

**Do you build websites?**

Yes! I made [this one](http://bisonstudio.co), [this one](http://designandcode.club), [this one](http://freelanceafternoon.com),

The one you're currently viewing was made with React.
<br/><br/>

**Do you build mobile apps?**

Yes! We have experience creating apps that are built in browser technology that are published to the app store using
[cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/).

It depends, usually not though.
